    This tutorial walks you through developing and deploying a Spring Boot todo list application with an Angular.js front-end.
    The application stores its data in the [Cosmos DB NoSQL database](), uses [Azure Active Directory]() for enterprise security,
    and [Azure Key Vault]() for secret management. The tutorial will first deploy the applications to [Azure Web App for Containers](), and then
    show you the steps for deploying to [Azure Kuberenetes Service]().

    This tutorial uses the [Azure CLI]() to create and configure the Azure resources needed by the application.
    You can use the second column of this tutorial to run the CLI commands in the browser.
